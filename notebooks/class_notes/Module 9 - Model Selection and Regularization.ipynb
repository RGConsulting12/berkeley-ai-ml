    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- • Identify the effect of polynomial features on Multidimensional data.\n",
    "- • Utilize sequential feature selection to explore model complexity.\n",
    "- • Apply regularization to control model complexity.\n",
    "- • Use regularization parameter \"alpha\" in ridge regression.\n",
    "- • Employ StandardScalar in ridge regularization.\n",
    "- • Scale data using standardization to avoid over-penalizing features in a regularized model.\n",
    "- • Apply GridSearchCV to select the optimal value for alpha.\n",
    "- • Select features using Lasso regression.\n",
    "- • Evaluate the differences between leave-one-out cross-validation, K-fold cross-validation, and holdout cross-validation.\n",
