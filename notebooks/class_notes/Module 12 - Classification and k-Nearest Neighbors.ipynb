    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- • Explain the concept of classification with an email spam detection example.\n",
    "- • Train a nearest neighbor classifier using cross-validation.\n",
    "- • Use k to minimize misclassification error.\n",
    "- • Use cross-validation to pick hyperparameters that optimize the metric of your choosing.\n",
    "- • Describe the effect on threshold and choice of k using the predict_proba function in scikit-learn.\n",
    "- • Create a visualization of KNN decision boundaries as a function of k and threshold.\n",
    "- • Assess the trade-offs between classifier metrics.\n",
    "- • Compute the real value output by using a regression function with KNN.\n",
    "- • Compare the accuracy and interpretability of a properly trained linear regression and a KNN regression model.\n",
