ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository supports my learning journey through the UC Berkeley Executive Educationâ€™s Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It contains organized Jupyter notebooks for each module of the course, beginning with Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and progressing through to the final practical applications. Each notebook includes:
	â€¢	Learning Outcomes from the course module (extracted and documented at the top of each file)
	â€¢	Hands-on code exercises aligned with course objectives
	â€¢	Notes and reflections for deepening understanding of key concepts

Notebooks were auto-generated using a custom script that parsed the course outline and programmatically created .ipynb files for efficient knowledge capture and version control. This structure allows for modular development, version tracking, and eventual integration of project artifacts, culminating in a final capstone deliverable â€” a production-ready app or website applying concepts learned throughout the course.
